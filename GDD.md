## General
> STS is a simple, 2D turn-base strategy game in which one builds an economy
> and trains an army to conquer their enemy.
> - Build an economy
> - Train a military
> - Conquer yur opponents capital

## Economy
> There are two resources:
> - **material** *[m]* (this is used to build buildings)
> - **food** *[f]* (this is used to train units)

> The **Capital** is the most important building for each player.
> If it is destroyed, the game is lost.  
> - Above average health
> - Trains *Pikemen*
> - Trains *Horsemen*
> - Trains *Archers*
> - Houses three units

> There are two economic buildings:
> - The **Mine** (generates *material*)
> - The **Farm** (generates *food*)

## Military
> There are three units which counter each other:
> - The **Pikemen** (a slow, melee unit with a counter-attack)
> - The **Horsemen** (a fast, melee unit)
> - The **Archer** (a slow, ranged unit)

> The combat and counter-system is strait forward:
> - The *Pikemen* is an effective counter towards the *Horsemen*, because of his counter-attack.
> - The *Horsemen* is an effective counter towards the *Archer*, because of his ability to close the distance.
> - The *Archer* is an effective counter towards the *Pikemen*, because he out-ranges him. 

> There is one military building:
> - The **House** (houses two units)
